  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p class="body-text">
    With an increasing amount of fast food options in today's society, convenient food options 
    have seemingly increased. However, as a result, our physical well-being might be suffering due 
    to increased fast food consumption. In our efforts to explore healthy eating practices, our team 
    has delved into the following <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shrutisaxena/food-nutrition-dataset">dataset</a> 
    which breaks down different food categories and their respective nutritional values.

    Through this project, we hope to help people understand the effects that different macronutrients and 
    micronutrients have on a person's physical health. By utilizing a variety of visualizations including heatmaps, 
    line graphs, and bubble charts, we aim to illustrate how your daily dietary choices play a role in your health.

  <h2>Why Should We Care?</h2>
  <p class="body-text">
    
    In a world where fast food and convenience meals are becoming the norm, it's essential to understand the 
    long-term impacts these choices can have on our health. Fast food is often high in unhealthy fats, sugars, 
    and sodium, which can lead to a variety of health issues such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and more. 
    By being informed about the nutritional content of different food categories, individuals can make better 
    dietary choices that promote overall health and well-being.

  <h2>Exploring Nutritional Values</h2>
  <p class="body-text">
    The <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shrutisaxena/food-nutrition-dataset">food nutrition dataset</a> 
    provides detailed information on various food items, including their protein, carbohydrate, fat, sugar, fiber, 
    sodium, calcium, vitamin C, vitamin B12, iron, and water content. By analyzing this data, we can gain insights 
    into which foods are nutrient-dense and which may contribute to unhealthy eating patterns.
